# Statistical-Analysis-of-Monte-Carlo-Simulation-for-Borehole-and-Cantilever-Models

The analysis of random outputs of borehole and cantilever utilizing Monte Carlo simulation has conducted. The probability density function can be approximated from the random variable distribution by using curve fitting. Besides that, the statistical properties, such as mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis are also calculated.
